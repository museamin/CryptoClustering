- This Jupyter notebook loads the stock data and then:
  - scales the data
  - clusters the data using KMeans on all dimensions
  - clusters the data using KMeans but with reduced dimensions using principle components analysis (PCA)
  - compares the results for the two types of clustering to see if shorter term or longer term factors affect the classification.
